Word Match
(Experimental gameplay assignment #4)
 

1. Inspiration - Word-cross Puzzle!

 

2. Goal

	a. Once I traveled to Toronto, I was amazed by many people playing word puzzles on newspaper when they are commuting on the metro. (There are a lot of immigrants in Toronto, that could be one of the reasons why.)

	b. Combining this with an image that people playing candy crush saga when they are commuting, I came up with an idea: Create a word match game for people who are learning language.

 

3. How to Achieve the Goal

	a. Use words replace colors to add a twist to the Match 3;
	
	b. Score is added by the length of the words you matched;
	
	c. Once word(s) is destroyed, the definition with an image of the word(s) will show on the screen to help people learn words.
 

4. Gameplay

	a. Click on an item, and then click on another item, if their distance is 1, then two items will exchange position;

	b. Once items exchanged, the program will search the max matched word (longest length) both horizontally and vertically, and destroy the words;

	c. Once words destroyed, your score will be added with the number of the length of these words.

	d. Try to get higher score!
 

5. What I Have Learned

	a. The purpose of this game to help people learn language instead of just playing match 3 game killing time, is somehow could be achieved. But to make it more playable, maybe adjustment of the possibility of vowels, certain dictionaries (show certain category of words in a level, like pet, fruit, furniture...), and different levels of difficulty should be applied.
